# hugues

Hugues is a skeleton theme for Hugo using Gulp and Sass.

The main purpose of this theme is to have the basic toolings to get started on simple static sites that don't require too much.

No Webpack. No Babel. No Parcel. Light &amp; easy to use.

## How to use

* `npm install` to install the couple of dependencies needed
* `npm run dev` when you are developing to handle `.scss` files
* `npm run build` to minify your assets
